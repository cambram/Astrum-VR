# Astrum-VR
## Description
I created this VR project during my honours year for my degree. It is a constellation viewer where you can view the night sky and various constellations. I used Unity to develop the project with the Meta Quest 2.

If you do not own a Meta Quest 2 headset, you can still see how the application works here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTCS1Ouj5Ik&t=2s
## Instructions
1. Download the Astrum.zip file from this repo.
2. Extract the contents and set up your Meta Quest 2 headset on your PC using Meta Quest Link.
3. Click Astrum-VR.exe and you can use the application.
