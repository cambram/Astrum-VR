This is VR project I created in my honours year of my degree. It is a constellation viewer where you are able to view the night sky and various different constelations. I used Unity to develop the project with the Meta Quest 2.
## Instructions

2. Extract the contents and set up your Meta Quest 2 headset on your PC using Meta Quest Link.
3. Click Astrum-VR.exe and you can use the application.
