## Description
I created this VR project during my honours year for my degree. It is a constellation viewer where you can view the night sky and various constellations. I used Unity to develop the project with the Meta Quest 2.
## Instructions
1. Download the Astrum.zip file from this repo.
2. Extract the contents and set up your Meta Quest 2 headset on your PC using Meta Quest Link.
3. Click Astrum-VR.exe and you can use the application.
